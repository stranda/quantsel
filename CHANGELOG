ver 0.11.5
9/14/10
rolled back a lot of the memory management to gnu-specific constructs.  The generic c++ "fixes" I applied caused horrible memory leaks
Will look into bringing kernelpop code into a more generic form...

1/24/10
lots of changes both internal and in userspace.

0.9.09 added const to take care of CHARSXP changes in 2.6
